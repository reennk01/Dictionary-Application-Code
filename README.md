PROJECT: DICTIONARY APPLICATION 
Introduction 
The Dictionary Application is designed to provide efficient storage, retrieval, and 
management of word definitions using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. This 
application allows users to interactively add new words, search for word meanings, update 
existing definitions, delete words, and view the entire dictionary. 
Objective 
The objective of this project is to create a robust and user-friendly dictionary application that 
leverages the BST data structure for quick lookup operations. By organizing words 
alphabetically, the application ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and search functionalities, 
providing a seamless experience for users accessing word definitions.
