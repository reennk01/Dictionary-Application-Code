# PROJECT: DICTIONARY APPLICATION 
# Introduction: 
The Dictionary Application is designed to provide efficient storage, retrieval, and 
management of word definitions using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. This 
application allows users to interactively add new words, search for word meanings, update 
existing definitions, delete words, and view the entire dictionary. 
# Objective: 
The objective of this project is to create a robust and user-friendly dictionary application that 
leverages the BST data structure for quick lookup operations. By organizing words 
alphabetically, the application ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and search functionalities, 
providing a seamless experience for users accessing word definitions.
